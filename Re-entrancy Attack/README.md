In this repository I have created ...
- A vunerable smart contract 
- An attacker contract to attack it
- A re-entrancy resistant contract using 2 methods 
    - Before call updates 
    - Modifiers 
- Attacker contract to attack it

The Attack is succesfull on the re-entrancy resistant contract not the re-entrancy vunerable.
